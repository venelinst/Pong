This is my take on the game pong

Instructions: 
Select an option by pressing the corresponding key in the game window (not the console window)
Move the players using w/s and up/down arrow keys
Hitting the ball with your player will cause it to change its direction, depending on how far the ball was from the center of your player
	when you hit it, hitting it with the center will send it back in a straight line,
	while hitting it with your corner will send it under an angle of up to 45 degrees
	hitting the ball while moving will make it faster, note: bots always speed up the ball on hit

I picked SDL because it seemed more beginner-friendly than SFML, and had no prior knowledge of c++ libraries before this project, 
	i learned about it by reading a bunch of tutorials and the SDL documentation here https://wiki.libsdl.org/CategoryAPI
	the functions i use are pretty basic-creating a rectangle for the entities in the game and rendering them,
	sometimes drawing lines too, and of course delays
In the code i've tried to explain the most important functions with comments near them
